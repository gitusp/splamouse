# Splamouse

This is a Joycon driver which supports gyro aiming!  
The mouse cursor behavior is heavily inspired by Splatoon.

## Tips

- Connect your Joycon(R) via bluetooth.
- Your Joycon may lost connection when there's no interaction for a while.
- If your Joycon is connected to your computer properly, but the cursor is not moving, try wiggling your stick.
- Reconnect your Joycon and restart this program if the connection problem still remains.
