# Splamouse

This turns a Pro Controller / Joy-con into a mouse which supports gyro aiming!  
The behavior is heavily inspired by Splatoon.

## How to use

- Connect your controller to your computer via Bluetooth.
- Download the latest binary from [Releases](https://github.com/gitusp/splamouse/releases).
    - There's for Apple Silicon(splamouse-macos-apple_silicon.zip) and for x86_64(splamouse-macos-x86_64.zip) binaries.
- Double click the downloaded zip to unarchive.
- Double click the unarchived binary to open.
    - Allow the program to be opened if a security dialog pops up.
    - A Terminal window should pop up once allowed.
    - Terminal app may also requests an accessibility permission for mouse operations.
- Then you can control the cursor with your controller. :tada:

## Tips

- Your controller may lose connection when there's no interaction for a while.
- If your controller is connected to your computer properly, but the cursor is not moving, try wiggling your stick.
- Reconnect your controller and restart this program if the connection problem still remains.
