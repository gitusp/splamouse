# Splamouse

This is a Pro Controller / Joy-con driver which supports gyro aiming!  
The mouse cursor behavior is heavily inspired by Splatoon.

- Double click the downloaded zip to unarchive.
- Double click the unarchived binary to open.
    - A Terminal window may pop up.
    - Allow the program to be opened if a security dialog pops up.
    - Terminal app may also requests an accessibility permission for mouse operations.
- Then you can control the cursor with your controller :tada:

## Tips

- Your controller may lose connection when there's no interaction for a while.
- If your controller is connected to your computer properly, but the cursor is not moving, try wiggling your stick.
- Reconnect your controller and restart this program if the connection problem still remains.
